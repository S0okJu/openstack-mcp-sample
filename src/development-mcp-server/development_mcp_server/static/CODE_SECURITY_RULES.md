# OpenStack Code Security Analysis Criteria

## Critical Security Issues to Detect

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials Detection

**What to Look For:**

- Password values directly assigned in code (`password = "secret123"`)
- API keys or tokens as string literals (`api_key = "sk-abc123"`)
- Authentication URLs with credentials embedded (`auth_url = "http://user:pass@keystone"`)
- Connection strings containing passwords (`openstack.connect(password="hardcoded")`)

**Severity:** HIGH - Immediate security risk, credentials exposed in source code

**Pattern Indicators:**

- Variables named: password, passwd, secret, token, key, credential
- String assignments to authentication parameters
- Base64 encoded strings that might contain credentials
- Configuration dictionaries with sensitive keys

### 2. SSL Certificate Verification Disabled

**What to Look For:**

- `verify=False` in any OpenStack connection or session
- `cert_verify=False` in configuration
- `ssl_verify=False` or similar SSL bypass parameters
- Custom SSL context that disables verification

**Severity:** HIGH - Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks

**Pattern Indicators:**

- Any `verify` parameter explicitly set to False
- SSL-related parameters disabled
- Custom SSL contexts without proper verification
- HTTP URLs for OpenStack endpoints instead of HTTPS

### 3. Input Validation Missing

**What to Look For:**

- Direct use of user input in OpenStack API calls without validation
- No length checks on user-provided strings
- Missing UUID format validation for resource IDs
- Unrestricted metadata or user_data acceptance

**Severity:** MEDIUM - Potential injection or resource abuse

**Pattern Indicators:**

- Function parameters passed directly to OpenStack APIs
- No input sanitization before API calls
- Missing bounds checking on numeric inputs
- Direct string concatenation with user input

### 4. Information Disclosure in Logs

**What to Look For:**

- Logging statements that include passwords, tokens, or secrets
- Debug output containing full exception details with credentials
- Print statements with sensitive authentication data
- Error messages exposing internal system information

**Severity:** MEDIUM - Credentials or sensitive data in logs

**Pattern Indicators:**

- Log/print statements containing credential-related variables
- Exception handling that exposes full error details
- Debug mode logging with authentication parameters
- Console output including sensitive configuration

### 5. Insufficient Error Handling

**What to Look For:**

- Bare `except:` clauses that catch all exceptions
- Generic exception handling that doesn't differentiate OpenStack errors
- Missing timeout handling for long-running operations
- No retry logic for transient failures

**Severity:** LOW - Poor error handling can mask security issues

**Pattern Indicators:**

- `except:` without specific exception types
- Generic `Exception` catching without re-raising
- Missing timeout parameters in API calls
- No distinction between different types of OpenStack errors

## Analysis Questions for Code Review

**Authentication & Authorization:**

- Are credentials stored externally (environment variables, config files)?
- Is SSL certificate verification enabled for all connections?
- Are authentication tokens handled securely (no logging, proper cleanup)?

**Input Validation:**

- Are all user inputs validated before OpenStack API calls?
- Are resource names checked for valid characters and length?
- Are UUIDs validated for proper format?
- Is user_data content sanitized and size-limited?

**Error Handling:**

- Are specific OpenStack exceptions caught rather than generic ones?
- Do error messages avoid exposing sensitive information?
- Are timeouts configured for potentially long-running operations?

**Logging & Monitoring:**

- Do log statements avoid including credentials or tokens?
- Are debug logs configured to exclude sensitive data?
- Is audit logging implemented for security-relevant operations?

**Resource Management:**

- Are OpenStack connections properly closed/cleaned up?
- Are there limits on resource creation to prevent abuse?
- Is there proper handling of quota exceeded errors?

## Risk Assessment Scoring

**Critical (Score: 9-10):**

- Hardcoded credentials in production code
- SSL verification completely disabled
- No input validation on public-facing APIs

**High (Score: 7-8):**

- Credentials logged in plaintext
- Generic exception handling masking security errors
- Missing authentication on sensitive operations

**Medium (Score: 4-6):**

- Incomplete input validation
- Overly verbose error messages
- Missing rate limiting or quotas

**Low (Score: 1-3):**

- Minor logging improvements needed
- Non-critical timeout configurations
- Documentation gaps in security procedures
